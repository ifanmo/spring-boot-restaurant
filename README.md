In order to test the API endpoint you must first register an account with a role of either
'CUSTOMER', 'MANAGER', 'WAITER', 'CHEF', or 'DELIVERY DRIVER'.

Customers must then create a customer profile, all other roles must create a staff profile.


The database is automatically populated with 10 sample menu items using a Flyway migration script.
