# Cafe-94 Restaurant API

## About this Repository 

This repository contains an API, created with Spring, for an all-in-one management system for a local restaurant.

The system is comprised of multiple features that are common to retail and food outlets.

It will provide login functionality for both customers and staff. Customers can create profile that includes their name, address, 
order history and any events they are attending. Staff profiles include their name, shifts and total hours worked

Customers can check availability and book a table for a given date. They can also view information about the menu, create orders (in-house, takeaway and delivery),
as well as book and register for catered events.

Staff will be divided into waiters, managers, chefs and delivery drivers. The system will allow staff members to carry
out common tasks associated with their respective roles. This includes handling customers' booking, event and order requests. 

Managers can also view weekly reports that include the busiest restaurant periods, most popular menu items, the staff member who worked
the most hours, as well as the most active customer
